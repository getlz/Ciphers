// This example is intended to provide a quick
// review of inheritance and polymorphism. It works
// with ciphers.

// NOTE: this is another bonus opportunity!!! Complete the code by creating two
//       derived classes. One for Caesar Cipher and 
//       one for another Substitution Cipher of your choice. You need to 
//       also run tests to illustrate that the encode and decode algorithms work.
//       send your solution to aofallon@wsu.edu by no later than
//       Friday, December 13. be sure to remove all debug, x64, and release
//       folders before you zip and attach your solution to the email.

// History: 11/8/24 - Set up the base class Cipher for two other classes to derive from it.
//                    Cipher is considered an abstract class (one that can't be instantiated)
//                    because it has at least one pure virtual function. We're really setting
//                    this up to be an interface like class.

#include "Caesar.hpp"

int main(void)
{
	//Cipher c; // can't instantiate because it's an abstract class

	return 0;
